-> The reference structure is: complex.1_b2AzqJx.pdb (the server adds a string at the end of some names for identification purposes)
-> The structures will be ranked by the binding affinity values showing the most active first
-> The Applicability Domain of the models will not be taken into account to filter the final structures
-> The identifier of the ligand is: C
