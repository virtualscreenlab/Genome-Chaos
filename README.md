# Genome-Chaos
During the progression of cancer cells, the degree of genome instability increases leading to genome chaos in populations of malignant cells. While normally chaos is associated with ergodic-ity, i.e., the state when the time average of relevant parameters is equal to the phase space average, the situation with cancer propagation is more complex.
